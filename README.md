# StringMatcher
This repository contains a Java program that matches a pattern string within a given input string using a custom matching algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter two strings, and then it finds and prints the index of the first occurrence of the pattern string within the input string. If no match is found, it prints "unmatched."
