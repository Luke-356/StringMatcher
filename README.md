# StringMatcher
This repository contains a Java program that matches a pattern string within a given input string using a custom matching algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter two strings, and then it finds and prints the index of the first occurrence of the pattern string within the input string. If no match is found, it prints "unmatched."

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source code (`Assignment10.java`) using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program using the Java interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input two strings.
5. The program will find and print the index of the first occurrence of the pattern string within the input string. If no match is found, it will print "unmatched."

## Algorithm Complexity

The worst-case time complexity of the matching algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
